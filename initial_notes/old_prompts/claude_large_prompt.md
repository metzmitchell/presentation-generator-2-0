### 3. Core Metrics & Business Logic

| KPI                               | Definition                                               | Calculation Source                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qualified Leads / Month**       | Inbound inquiries that pass the qualification checklist. | Count of new CRM rows with status = “Qualified” whose `Created Date` falls in the month.                                                    |
| **Pipeline \$ Created / Month**   | Dollar value of new opportunities created.               | Σ `Project Estimate` for rows first marked “Opportunity” in the month.                                                                      |
| **Signed Contract Value / Month** | Revenue booked when deals close.                         | Σ `Contract Price` where `Stage` = “Won” during the month.                                                                                  |
| **Backlog (Months)**              | Months of work secured at current production pace.       | `(Σ Remaining Contract Value) ÷ (Average Monthly Production Capacity $)`. If production-capacity dollars unavailable, leave blank and flag. |
| **Jobs Won from Referrals (%)**   | Share of closed-won deals sourced by referral.           | `(Closed-won with Lead Source containing “Referral”) ÷ (Total closed-won)`.                                                                 |

### 4. GA4 → Sales-Sheet Alignment

* No strict shared key exists.
* Attempt soft attribution (e.g., match by email/phone + close date ≈ first session date).
* If matching is inconclusive, discuss high-level correlations only.

---

### 5. Economic Context

* With Perplexity MCP, pull **3–5** recent data points (permits, material costs, interest rates, etc.).
* Summarize in ≤150 words; simple parenthetical sources are fine.

---

### 6. Visual & Narrative Requirements

1. **Charts**

   * Include lots of visuals
   * Highlight MoM % changes
   * Correlation graphic 

2. **Storytelling**

   * Executive summary (≤200 words) up front.
   * Section tying economic context to KPI shifts.
   * Placeholder section: **“Financial & ROMI Insights – To be added when cost data becomes available.”**

3. **Design**

   * Muted, construction-appropriate palette (blues/greens/grays) 
   * Owner-friendly formatting—clear headings, concise bullets.

---

### 7. Deliverable

Produce a **shareable Claude Artifact web page** (default Anthropic format) that:

* Embeds interactive charts (or static images if interactivity not supported).
* Includes expandable “Data & Methods” and “Assumptions & Data Gaps” appendices.
* Can be exported by the user to PDF if desired.

---

### 8. Error Handling & Follow-ups

* **No Assumptions**
  \*If any required field, mapping, or business rule cannot be verified directly from GA4, the spreadsheet, or an external cited source, **do NOT fabricate a value.** 

---

### 9. Step-by-Step Workflow for Deep Research

1. **Understand requirements**
2. **Look at data** from GA4 (past 6 months) and from the Google Sheet.
3. **Inspect schema**, identify required columns, and map them; halt and ask the user if critical columns are missing.
4. **Clean & structure data** (dates, numeric fields). Do not edit Google Analytics directly.
5. **Compute KPIs** 
6. **Fetch economic context** via Perplexity MCP; store citations.
7. **Generate visualizations** for each KPI plus the correlation chart.
8. **Compose narrative**: executive summary, KPI commentary, economic tie-ins, ROMI placeholder, understand business goals.
9. **Assemble the artifact** (charts, text, appendices).
10. **Deliver the artifact**.

### 10. Tone & Length

* Main report ≤8 pages/slides plus appendices.
