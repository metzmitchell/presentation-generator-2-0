# GitHub Template Research Prompt

## Objective
Find the best GitHub starter template for a presentation generator web application that prioritizes AI reliability and visual-first design.

## Core Requirements

### AI-First Architecture
- **Primary Priority**: Must support reliable AI code generation with >95% success rate
- **Single-Prompt Generation**: Template should allow complete presentation creation from one AI prompt
- **Predictable Patterns**: Clear, consistent component structure that AI can reliably work with
- **Zero Design Breaks**: Architecture must prevent AI from accidentally breaking visual elements

### Technical Specifications
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (minimal, clean setup preferred)
- **Content**: MDX support for presentation content
- **Hosting**: Vercel deployment ready
- **Performance**: Lightweight, minimal dependencies

### Presentation-Specific Features
- **Visual-First**: Designed for visual storytelling, not text-heavy content
- **Slide Components**: Support for slide-based content structure
- **Data Visualization**: Chart/graph capabilities (Recharts or Chart.js integration)
- **Animation Support**: Smooth transitions and effects (Framer Motion preferred)
- **Interactive Elements**: Timeline changes, hover effects, clickable features

### Content Management
- **File-Based**: MDX files for presentations (no CMS complexity)
- **Monthly Structure**: Support for organized content by time periods
- **Data Integration**: Ability to import and display spreadsheet data

## What to Avoid
- Blog-focused templates (too text-heavy, wrong UX patterns)
- Complex CMS integrations
- Heavy feature sets that could confuse AI generation
- Templates with poor TypeScript implementation
- Overly complex component libraries

## Research Focus Areas
1. **Presentation/Slide Frameworks**: Look for templates specifically designed for presentations, slides, or visual storytelling
2. **AI-Friendly Templates**: Templates with clean, predictable code structure
3. **Data Visualization Templates**: Templates that handle charts and data display well
4. **Minimal Next.js Setups**: Clean, lightweight Next.js templates without unnecessary complexity

## Search Terms to Use
- "Next.js presentation template"
- "React slide deck template"  
- "Next.js data visualization template"
- "TypeScript presentation framework"
- "MDX presentation template"
- "Next.js AI-friendly template"

## Evaluation Criteria
Rate each template on:
1. **AI Reliability** (1-10): How predictable and AI-friendly is the code structure?
2. **Visual Focus** (1-10): How well does it support visual-first content?
3. **Performance** (1-10): How lightweight and fast is it?
4. **Presentation Features** (1-10): Does it have slide/presentation-specific capabilities?
5. **TypeScript Quality** (1-10): How comprehensive is the TypeScript implementation?
